PEP

To test mobile carrier's features, you just need to run feature_tester.py after tethering.

Input carrier name and location and then wait for it to finish (it will ask you to save current result or not after finishing).

The data will be saved to ./PEP_carriername_location_randomnumber, so you need keep such folder and send it to me.

I think run it multiple times will be better (at L.A., I observe that sometimes, though very rare, TMobile is not caching.)

I may also refine it, meanwhile, let me know if you see any problems.
